# My Blog Posts

Hi all! ðŸ‘‹ 

In this repository, I collect drafts and published Jupyter Notebooks for blog posts on [my website](https://matteocourthoud.github.io/) and [Medium](https://medium.com/@matteo.courthoud). I write to learn and help others.

Misquoting Confucio: "*I hear and I forget. I see and I remember. I write a post and I understand.*"

If you have suggestions for new posts, let me know! Hug ðŸ¤—
